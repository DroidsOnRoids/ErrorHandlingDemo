//Examples of usage:

var fridge = Fridge(milk: false, eggs: true)

} catch BreakfastErrors.noEggs {

} catch BreakfastErrors.noMilk {
    print("go and buy some milk")

//Example of not using do-catch block but forcing the call

//I'm sure eggs are in the fridge

let breakfast = try! scrambledEggs(fridge)

//One more example with empty fridge

fridge.milk = false
fridge.eggs = false

do {
    try pancakes(fridge)
} catch BreakfastErrors.emptyFridge {
    print("fill the fridge")
} catch BreakfastErrors.noEggs {

} catch BreakfastErrors.noMilk {
    print("go and buy some milk")
}  catch {
    print("something else..")

//Another example with using only two catch block, but fulfilling all cases
do {
    try pancakes(fridge)
} catch let error as BreakfastErrors {
    switch error {
    case .emptyFridge:
        print("fill the fridge")
    case .noEggs:
        print("go and buy some eggs")
    case .noMilk:
        print("go and buy some milk")
    }
} catch {
    print("something else")
